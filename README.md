<p align="center"><p style="color:purple;"><b>Welcome to my GitHub</b></p>
<p align="center">I discovered that there is a handful of players on Pony Town that have a GitGub account attached to their profiles with more information about them. It seemed so silly to me, but now here I am trying to play around with it.
At the bottom of this post there is a link that will take you to a Multiboard Magma Canvas where you can draw with your friends! Feel free to draw your OCs, or OCs you see on PonyTown. Leave your @s if you're particularly proud of a sketch! So come swing by to draw. I'd love to see what you guys do with this.</p>
<p align="center">RULES</p>
<p align="center">- Be respectful. Don't draw anything on here that would get you in trouble.</p>
<p align="center">- No sexually explicit content. Let's keep this lighthearted, fun, and PG.</p>
