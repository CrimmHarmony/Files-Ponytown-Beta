  <p align="center">It was brought to my attention recently that there's a niche amount of Pony Town players who have GitHub accounts attached to their pony avatars in-game with general information about their interests and links to other social media in their bios. I would have never thought to do something like this as a roundabout way to create a "profile" for fellow players to see. Now that I know it exists? I'm going to have some fun with it!</p>
